# PVC-Bot

Music Practicum Project for Humanities Requirement (HUA 3910) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

This project is a pitched percussive aerophone designed to use carefully tuned PVC pipes resonated by jets of compressed air. 
Solenoid valves are driven by a custom SPI-capable PCB controlled by an Arduino Uno to provide air to each tube. 
Pieces composed for the instrument make use of its virtuosity with fast sections and complex time and rhythms. 
Compositions are transmitted to the Arduino as MIDI messages over UART. 
Development will continue as research for WPI MPR Lab.
